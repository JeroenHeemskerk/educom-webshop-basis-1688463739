# Introduction HTML / CSS / PHP as a basis for a Webshop

## Module
In this module we will successively create three HTML pages and then style them with CSS. Then we will handle the processing of a contact form with PHP. In the second week we will rewrite the code to add more structure to it and then expand the site with a registration, login & logout functionality. We initially use a text file where we store the registered users. In the module that follows, we will do that with a database and turn this site into a real webshop.

The following illustration breaks down web development into its core parts.
